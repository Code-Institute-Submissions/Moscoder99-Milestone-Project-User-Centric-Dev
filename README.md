# Milestone-Project-User-Centric-Dev

## Website Summary:
------

This website is a website for St. Fictional’s school that facilitates the school in sharing information with stakeholders including parents, teachers, students and the community. It provides a single point of contact with the school that stakeholders can consult for information on several school related topics. It enhances the stakeholder’s experience of dealing with the school because information is more easily accessible, replacing phone calls to the school and reducing the time involved in sharing information for both stakeholders and school staff. The website also replaces the requirement for leaflet and paper distributions historically associated with announcing school events and disseminating information.
By publishing information on this site, the school can ensure that accurate information about the school is easily available to anyone who wishes to access it, and the accuracy is not diluted by word of mouth communication. The website also showcases the achievements of the school online, which can be referenced by those researching schools in the area or prospective students.
