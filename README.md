# Milestone-Project-User-Centric-Dev

This website is a prototype or sample of a website serving an individual school.

This website facilitates the school's need to disseminate information about the school to parents, teachers, students and the community.
These users can easily access important information about the school as a result.
The webiste enables the school to represent the school well online and reduce the need for leaflet and paper distributions.

UX:

The website is primarily for those operating outside of the school who have an interest in information about the school and what happens there.
This website presents important information using a simple and easy to understand set of web pages that are easy to navigate.
The information provided is clear and to the point, and colourful, simple colours and graphics are used to illustrate the information being provided.
The website has been developed in a manner ensuring it can be easily read on multiple device types including computer screens, tablets and mobile phones.
This ensures the website audience can access the information presented in many ways, for example, while at a computer in an office or on a mobile phone using wifi.

Features
This school website consists of four distinct features, each captured in a section/page of the website:

1. The Home section, which includes the About information and a map and directions to the school
2. A section on the history of the school and local community.
3. A section describing some important events in the school's recent history.
4. A section containing all of the information to contact the school, and the school's opening hours.

Future feature ideas include:
1. Adding a form for submitting an email.
2. Adding an idea submission or suggestion button and form.

Technologies Used:
The Bootstrap framework was used to provide the majority of the lauout and formatting requirements for this project.
Font Awesome was used to facilitate the display of two icons on the page footer.
A local style.css file was used for any formating not provided by Bootstrap, this was mainly to use a wider range of backgroound colours than those available with Bootstrap.
